# IL1331_VHDL_Design
The code in this repo is from the last lab of the course IL1331 VHDL Design.
I have written control logic for a tiny CISC CPU. The design includes a ROM
which sets the correct bits for a instruction.

The program instructions are in the mif file I created.

The program was written and tested in a virtual test bench in ModelSim. There I could inspect all of the bits
for each instruction. 
I then transferred the code over to an FPGA.
